## New York Taxi Fare Prediction 🚖💰
This project leverages Regression algorithms such as Random Forest, Decision Tree, AdaBoost, and XGBoost to predict taxi fares in New York City.

The dataset used is from a Kaggle competition, and you can find it here. https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction/data

#### 📌 Features
✅ Implements multiple regression algorithms for fare prediction

✅ Preprocesses real-world NYC taxi trip data

✅ Evaluates models using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score

✅ Hyperparameter tuning for improved model accuracy

✅ Visualizes results using matplotlib & seaborn
